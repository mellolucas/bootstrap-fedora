# bootstrap-fedora
Full OS (Linux Fedora) setup, totally from scratch (from bootable flash drive), using a kickstart script and Ansible.

The kickstart script is yet to come and full instructions are on the way.
Until then, fell free to play it out: after installing fedora, run:
`source <(wget -qO- https://raw.github.com/mellolucas/bootstrap-fedora/main/bootstrap.sh)`
and follow the instructions you'll be presented with.
